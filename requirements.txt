The goal for this project is to build an AI that suggests books based on user preferences.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12.3
- pip 24.2.1
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow

## Data
- The data is in the `data` folder.
- The data is in the form of CSV files.
- This are the fields in csv file:
FieldName	FieldDefinition

## Methods
- Use pandas to read the csv files.
- We will use a Hybrid Model combining Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering for the recommendation system.
- Use scikit-learn for collaborative filtering and content-based filtering components.
- Add TensorFlow for neural network-based enhancements.

## Steps
- Read the csv files.
- Clean the data.
- Build the Hybrid Model.
  - Collaborative Filtering: Leverage user ratings and interactions.
  - Content-Based Filtering: Use book metadata (genres, authors, etc.).
- Train the model.
- Test the model using a train-test split.
- Suggest books based on user preferences.

## Output
- The output will be a csv file with the suggested books and metadata explaining the recommendation.
