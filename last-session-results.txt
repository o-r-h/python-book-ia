Youâ€™re welcome! Weâ€™ve made great progress today. Hereâ€™s a quick recap of what we achieved:

Summary of Work Done:
Data Cleaning:
    Loaded the dataset and removed missing values.
    Dropped the price column and ensured ratings were valid.
Feature Engineering:
    Extracted genres and authors, creating binary matrices.
    Normalized ratings and combined features into a single matrix.

Hybrid Recommendation Model:
    Implemented collaborative filtering using user ratings.
    Implemented content-based filtering using book features.
    Combined both approaches to generate hybrid recommendations.

Next Steps for Future Sessions:
    Understand the Code:
        Review the implementation of collaborative and content-based filtering.
        Explore the hybrid modelâ€™s logic and how recommendations are combined.
    Refine the Model:
        Adjust weights or add more features to improve recommendation quality.
    Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance with user feedback.
    Optimize and Scale:
        Optimize the model for larger datasets if needed.

Feel free to reach out whenever youâ€™re ready to continue. Have a great day, and see you in the next session! ðŸ˜Š
