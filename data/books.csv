375802.Ender_s_Game,Ender's Game,Ender's Saga #1,"Orson Scott Card, Stefan Rudnicki (Narrator), Harlan Ellison (Narrator)",4.3,"Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin thinks he is playing computer simulated war games; he is, in fact, engaged in something far more desperate. The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.Source: hatrack.com",English,9780812550702,"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'War', 'Audiobook', 'Adventure']","['Dink', 'Bernard', 'Valentine Wiggin', 'Peter Wiggin', 'Mazer Rackham', 'Alai', 'Hyrum Graff', 'Andrew Wiggin', 'Petra Arkanian', '""Bean""', 'Major Anderson', 'Bonzo', 'Major Imbu']",Audiobook,Unabridged,324,Macmillan Audio,09/30/04,10/28/85,"['Hugo Award for Best Novel (1986)', 'Nebula Award for Best Novel (1985)', 'Nébula (1985)', 'Margaret A.

Tom lives with his Aunt Polly, half-brother Sid, and cousin Mary in the quaint town of St. Petersburg, just off the shore of the Mississippi River. St. Petersburg is described as a typical small-town atmosphere where the Christian faith is predominant, the social network is close-knit, and familiarity resides.  Unlike his brother Sid, Tom receives ""lickings"" from his Aunt Polly; ever the mischief-maker, would rather play hooky than attend school and often sneaks out his bedroom window at night to adventure with his friend, Huckleberry Finn ­ the town's social outcast. Tom, despite his dread of schooling, is extremely clever and would normally get away with his pranks if Sid were not such a ""tattle-tale.""  As punishment for skipping school to go swimming, Aunt Polly assigns Tom the chore of whitewashing the fence surrounding the house. In a brilliant scheme, Tom is able to con the neighborhood boys into completing the chore for him, managing to convince them of the joys of whitewashing. At school, Tom is equally as flamboyant, and attracts attention by chasing other boys, yelling, and running around. With his usual antics, Tom attempts to catch the eye of Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town, and persuades her to get ""engaged"" by kissing him. But their romance collapses when she learns Tom has been ""engaged"" previously to Amy Lawrence. Shortly after Becky shuns him, he accompanies Huckleberry Finn to the graveyard at night, where they witness the murder of Dr. Robinson.Excerpt:""TOM!"" No answer. ""TOM!"" No answer. ""What's gone with that boy,  I wonder? You TOM!"" No answer. The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or never looked through them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for ""style,"" not service—she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well. She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the furniture to hear: ""Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll—"" She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with.

24337.Ella_Enchanted,Ella Enchanted,Ella Enchanted #1,Gail Carson Levine (Goodreads Author),3.98,"At birth, Ella is inadvertently cursed by an imprudent young fairy named Lucinda, who bestows on her the ""gift"" of obedience. Anything anyone tells her to do, Ella must obey. Another girl might have been cowed by this affliction, but not feisty Ella: ""Instead of making me docile, Lucinda's curse made a rebel of me. Or perhaps I was that way naturally."" When her beloved mother dies, leaving her in the care of a mostly absent and avaricious father, and later, a loathsome stepmother and two treacherous stepsisters, Ella's life and well-being seem to be in grave peril. But her intelligence and saucy nature keep her in good stead as she sets out on a quest for freedom and self-discovery as she tries to track down Lucinda to undo the curse, fending off ogres, befriending elves, and falling in love with a prince along the way. Yes, there is a pumpkin coach, a glass slipper, and a happily ever after, but this is the most remarkable, delightful, and profound version of Cinderella you'll ever read.Gail Carson Levine's examination of traditional female roles in fairy tales takes some satisfying twists and deviations from the original. Ella is bound by obedience against her will, and takes matters in her own hands with ambition and verve. Her relationship with the prince is balanced and based on humor and mutual respect; in fact, it is she who ultimately rescues him. Ella Enchanted has won many well-deserved awards, including a Newbery Honor.",English,9780590920681,"['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Fairy Tales', 'Childrens', 'Middle Grade', 'Retellings', 'Magic', 'Adventure']","['Ella Varner', 'Lucinda', 'Mandy', 'Prince Charmont', 'Areida', 'Hattie', 'Olive Abroholos Elephanta']",Paperback,First Scholastic Edition,232,Scholastic Books,09/01/98,04/25/97,"['Newbery Medal Nominee (1998)', ""Mythopoeic Fantasy Award Nominee for Children's Literature (1999)"", 'Grand Canyon Reader Award for Teen Book (1999)', 'Maryland Black-Eyed Susan Book Award for Grade 6-9 (2000)', ""Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children's Book Award (1999)"", 'Iowa Teen Award (2000)', 'California Young Readers Medal for Middle School/Junior High (2000)', ""Rebecca Caudill Young Readers' Book Award (2000)""]",386881,"['146547', '123656', '86772', '21924', '7982']",92.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410727190l/24337.jpg,54609,680,1.91

For when kings clash, the whole land trembles.Here is the second volume in George R.R. Martin magnificent cycle of novels that includes A Game of Thrones and A Storm of Swords.

Thus begins a journey of 20,000 leagues—nearly 50,000 miles—that will take Captain Nemo, his crew, and these three adventurers on a journey of discovery through undersea forests, coral graveyards, miles-deep trenches, and even the sunken ruins of Atlantis.

1202.Freakonomics,Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything,Freakonomics,"Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner (Goodreads Author)",3.98,"Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.(front flap)",English,9780061234002,"['Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'Business', 'Science', 'Psychology', 'Sociology', 'Politics', 'Finance', 'Audiobook', 'Social Science']",[],Hardcover,Revised and Expanded Edition (US/CAN),320,William Morrow,10/17/06,04/12/05,"['Book Sense Book of the Year Award for Adult Nonfiction (2006)', 'Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Nominee for Shortlist (2005)', 'The Quill Award for Business (2005)']",708708,"['245341', '272578', '139864', '32567', '18358']",93.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1550917827l/1202._SX318_.jpg,10521,140,8.33

The half-destroyed cities have become uninhabitable through radiation. Beyond their boundaries, they say, lie endless burned-out deserts and the remains of splintered forests. Survivors still remember the past greatness of humankind. But the last remains of civilisation have already become a distant memory, the stuff of myth and legend. More than 20 years have passed since the last plane took off from the earth. Rusted railways lead into emptiness. The ether is void and the airwaves echo to a soulless howling where previously the frequencies were full of news from Tokyo, New York, Buenos Aires. Man has handed over stewardship of the earth to new life-forms. Mutated by radiation, they are better adapted to the new world. Man's time is over. A few score thousand survivors live on, not knowing whether they are the only ones left on earth. They live in the Moscow Metro - the biggest air-raid shelter ever built. It is humanity's last refuge. Stations have become mini-statelets, their people uniting around ideas, religions, water-filters - or the simple need to repulse an enemy incursion. It is a world without a tomorrow, with no room for dreams, plans, hopes. Feelings have given way to instinct - the most important of which is survival. Survival at any price. VDNKh is the northernmost inhabited station on its line. It was one of the Metro's best stations and still remains secure. But now a new and terrible threat has appeared. Artyom, a young man living in VDNKh, is given the task of penetrating to the heart of the Metro, to the legendary Polis, to alert everyone to the awful danger and to get help.

  As an ancient Sumerian god, Sin was one of the most powerful among his pantheon.  . . Until the night Artemis brutally stole his godhood and left him for dead. For millennia, this ex-god turned Dark-Hunter has dreamed only of regaining his powers and seeking revenge on Artemis. If only life were that simple. Unfortunately he has bigger fish--or in Sin's case--demons, to fry. The lethal gallu that were buried by his pantheon are now stirring and they are hungry for human flesh. Their goal is to destroy mankind and anyone else who gets in their way.  Sin is the only one who can stop them--that is if a certain woman doesn't kill him first. Unfortunately, Sin discovers that now he must rely on her or witness an annihilation of biblical proportions.  Enemies have always made strange bedfellows, but never more so than when the fate of the world hangs in the balance. Now a man who knows only betrayal must trust the one person most likely to hand him to the demons. Artemis may have stolen his godhood, but this one has stolen his heart. The only question is will she keep it or feed it to the ones who want him dead?

It is Christmas, and Daniel Sempere and his wife Bea have much to celebrate. They have a beautiful new baby son named Julian, and their close friend Fermín Romero de Torres is about to be wed. But their joy is eclipsed when a mysterious stranger visits the Sempere bookshop and threatens to divulge a terrible secret that has been buried for two decades in the city's dark past.

158770.Three_Kingdoms,Three Kingdoms,Four Great Classic Novels of China,"Luo Guanzhong, Moss Roberts (Translator)",4.38,"Complete and unabridged, Moss Roberts's translation provides an authoritative, annotated English-language version of one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. ""The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been."" With this characterization of the inevitable cycle of Chinese history, the monumental tale Three Kingdoms begins. As important for Chinese culture as the Homeric epics have been for the West, this Ming Dynasty masterpiece continues to be read and loved throughout China as well as in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. The novel offers a startling and unsparing view of how power is wielded, how diplomacy is conducted, and how wars are planned and fought; it has influenced the ways that Chinese think about power, diplomacy, and war even to this day.Three Kingdoms portrays a fateful moment at the end of the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-A.D. 220) when the future of the Chinese empire lay in the balance. Writing more than a millennium later, Luo Guanzhong drew on often told tales of this turbulent period to fashion a sophisticated compelling narrative, whose characters display vivid individuality and epic grandeur.The story begins when the emperor, fearing uprisings by peasant rebels known as the Yellow Scarves, sends an urgent appeal to the provinces for popular support. In response, three young men - the aristocratic Liu Xuande, the fugitive Lord Guan, and the pig-butcher Zhang Fei - meet to pledge eternal brotherhood and fealty to their beleaguered government. From these events comes a chain of cause and consequence that leads ultimately to the collapse of the Han.",English,9787119005904,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'China', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Historical', 'Chinese Literature', 'Asia', 'War', 'Novels']","['刘备', '曹操', '孙权', '诸葛亮', '关羽', '张飞', '周瑜', '赵云', '汉献帝', '吕布', '司马懿', '刘备', '诸葛亮', '关羽', '吕布', '张飞', '孙权']",Paperback,4-Volume Boxed Set,2339,Foreign Language Press,December 1st 1995,10/28/22,[],4159,"['2412', '1128', '453', '103', '63']",96.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1519909801l/158770.jpg,954,10,20.99

Solomon has just begun work on his marvelous temple, charging Khaba, a formidable magician in his royal court, to oversee its construction. The workforce is an ill-behaved bunch of demons, a particularly unruly djinni named Bartimaeus among them. True to form, Bartimaeus promptly gets kicked off the temple project and assigned the even more miserable task of hunting bandits in the desert. There he crosses paths with Asmira, a highly skilled and loyal captain of the Queen of Sheba’s guard, on a suicidal mission to save her country from Solomon’s imminent attack. Of course, Bartimaeus has no intention of helping her. That is, until Asmira makes him an offer he cannot refuse. . . .A spellbinding addition to Jonathan Stroud’s New York Times bestselling Bartimaeus audiobooks, The Ring of Solomon brims with dazzling wit, unforgettable characters, and powerful themes of freedom and slavery, with or without magical bonds.",English,9780307738615,"['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Magic', 'Adventure', 'Humor', 'Audiobook', 'Middle Grade', 'Young Adult Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction']","['Bartimaeus', 'Ezekiel', 'King Solomon', 'Hiram', 'Khaba', 'Faquarl', 'Queen Balkis', 'Asmira']",Audio CD,Unabridged,13,Listening Library,November 9th 2010,10/14/10,['Premio El Templo de las Mil Puertas Nominee for Mejor novela extranjera perteneciente a saga (2011)'],27341,"['12239', '9852', '4173', '694', '383']",96.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348894736l/7640705.jpg,938,12,14.63
1148721.The_Fionavar_Tapestry,The Fionavar Tapestry,The Fionavar Tapestry #1-3,Guy Gavriel Kay (Goodreads Author),4.21,"In the three novels that make up the Fionavar Tapestry trilogy collected in this omnibus edition (The Summer Tree, The Wandering Fire, and The Darkest Road), five University of Toronto students find themselves transported to a magical land to do battle with the forces of evil. At a Celtic conference, Kimberley, Kevin, Jennifer, Dave, and Paul meet wizard Loren Silvercloak. Returning with him to the magical kingdom of Fionavar to attend a festival, they soon discover that they are being drawn into the conflict between the dark and the light as Unraveller Rakoth Maugrim breaks free of his mountain prison and threatens the continued existence of Fionavar. They join mages, elves, dwarves, and the forces of the High King of Brennin to do battle with Maugrim, where Kay's imaginative powers as a world-builder come to the fore. He stunningly weaves Arthurian legends into the fluid mix of Celtic, Nordic, and Teutonic, creating a grand fantasy that sweeps readers into a heroic struggle that the author makes all the more memorable because of the tributes he pays to past masters.  The trilogy is a grand homage to J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, but while the echoes of Tolkien's masterwork are very real, the books offer the wonderful taste of a new fantasy writer cutting his teeth at the foot of a master. Kay has a very real connection to Tolkien--as Christopher Tolkien's assistant, Kay was invaluable in helping to wrestle Tolkien's posthumous The Silmarillion into shape for publication. Kay is undoubtedly one of the Canadian masters of high fantasy, and The Fionavar Tapestry is one of his most enduring works. Readers, however, should also check out Kay's Tigana, A Song for Arbonne, The Lions of Al-Rassan, and The Sarantine Mosaic to truly experience a master at work. --Jeffrey Canton ",English,9780006479505,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Canada', 'High Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Arthurian', 'Mythology', 'Adult', 'Adventure']",[],Paperback,First Thus edition,792,HarperCollins Publishers Canada,1995,10/28/86,['Mythopoeic Fantasy Award Nominee (1987)'],6787,"['3378', '2032', '967', '272', '138']",94.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1181410214l/1148721._SY475_.jpg,933,11,16.67

  Furnace Penitentiary: the world’s most secure prison for young offenders, buried a mile beneath the earth’s surface. Convicted of a murder he didn’t commit, sentenced to life without parole, “new fish” Alex Sawyer knows he has two choices: find a way out, or resign himself to a death behind bars, in the darkness at the bottom of the world. Except in Furnace, death is the least of his worries. Soon Alex discovers that the prison is a place of pure evil, where inhuman creatures in gas masks stalk the corridors at night, where giants in black suits drag screaming inmates into the shadows, where deformed beasts can be heard howling from the blood-drenched tunnels below. And behind everything is the mysterious, all-powerful warden, a man as cruel and dangerous as the devil himself, whose unthinkable acts have consequences that stretch far beyond the walls of the prison. Together with a bunch of inmates—some innocent kids who have been framed, others cold-blooded killers—Alex plans an escape. But as he starts to uncover the truth about Furnace’s deeper, darker purpose, Alex’s actions grow ever more dangerous, and he must risk everything to expose this nightmare that’s hidden from the eyes of the world.

He lives in a small English village with his wife, Maureen, who seems irritated by almost everything he does, even down to how he butters his toast. Little differentiates one day from the next. Then one morning the mail arrives, and within the stack of quotidian minutiae is a letter addressed to Harold in a shaky scrawl from a woman he hasn't seen or heard from in twenty years. Queenie Hennessy is in hospice and is writing to say goodbye. Harold pens a quick reply and, leaving Maureen to her chores, heads to the corner mailbox. But then, as happens in the very best works of fiction, Harold has a chance encounter, one that convinces him that he absolutely must deliver his message to Queenie in person. And thus begins the unlikely pilgrimage. Harold Fry is determined to walk six hundred miles from Kingsbridge to the hospice in Berwick-upon-Tweed because, he believes, as long as he walks, Queenie Hennessey will live. Still in his yachting shoes and light coat, Harold embarks on his urgent quest across the countryside. Along the way he meets one character after another, each of whom unlocks his long-dormant spirit and sense of promise. Memories of his first dance with Maureen, his wedding day, his joy in fatherhood, come rushing back to him - allowing him to also reconcile the losses and the regrets. As for Maureen, she finds herself missing Harold for the first time in years.

The Grandet household, oppressed by the exacting miserliness of Grandet himself, is jerked violently out of routine by the sudden arrival of Eugenie's cousin Charles, recently orphaned and penniless. Eugenie's emotional awakening, stimulated by her love for her cousin, brings her into direct conflict with her father, whose cunning and financial success are matched against her determination to rebel. Eugenie's moving story is set against the backdrop of provincial oppression, the vicissitudes of the wine trade, and the workings of the financial system in the aftermath of the French Revolution.

Here is the continuation of her fascinating story. In 1984, Marjane flees fundamentalism and the war with Iraq to begin a new life in Vienna. Once there, she faces the trials of adolescence far from her friends and family, and while she soon carves out a place for herself among a group of fellow outsiders, she continues to struggle for a sense of belonging.Finding that she misses her home more than she can stand, Marjane returns to Iran after graduation. Her difficult homecoming forces her to confront the changes both she and her country have undergone in her absence and her shame at what she perceives as her failure in Austria. Marjane allows her past to weigh heavily on her until she finds some like-minded friends, falls in love, and begins studying art at a university. However, the repression and state-sanctioned chauvinism eventually lead her to question whether she can have a future in Iran.As funny and poignant as its predecessor, Persepolis 2 is another clear-eyed and searing condemnation of the human cost of fundamentalism. In its depiction of the struggles of growing up--here compounded by Marjane's status as an outsider both abroad and at home--it is raw, honest, and incredibly illuminating.",English,9780375714665,"['Graphic Novels', 'Nonfiction', 'Comics', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'History', 'Iran', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir']",[],Paperback,First American Paperback Edition,187,Pantheon Books,August 2nd 2005,07/01/01,"[""Prix du Festival d'Angoulême for Alph-art du meilleur scénario (2002)""]",62957,"['28694', '23041', '8833', '1700', '689']",96.0,"['Tehran (Iran)', 'Vienna (Austria)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327865598l/9517.jpg,444,6,5.78

The Nobel Prize-winning writer's masterwork is the engrossing story of a Muslim family in Cairo during Britain's occupation of Egypt in the early decades of the twentieth century.The novels of The Cairo Trilogy trace three generations of the family of tyrannical patriarch Al-Sayyid Ahmad Abd al-Jawad, who rules his household with a strict hand while living a secret life of self-indulgence. Palace Walk introduces us to his gentle, oppressed wife, Amina, his cloistered daughters, Aisha and Khadija, and his three sons–the tragic and idealistic Fahmy, the dissolute hedonist Yasin, and the soul-searching intellectual Kamal. Al-Sayyid Ahmad’s rebellious children struggle to move beyond his domination in Palace of Desire, as the world around them opens to the currents of modernity and political and domestic turmoil brought by the 1920s. Sugar Street brings Mahfouz’s vivid tapestry of an evolving Egypt to a dramatic climax as the aging patriarch sees one grandson become a Communist, one a Muslim fundamentalist, and one the lover of a powerful politician.Throughout the trilogy, the family's trials mirror those of their turbulent country during the years spanning the two World Wars, as change comes to a society that has resisted it for centuries.

Rider Haggard,3.58,"She is the story of Cambridge professor Horace Holly and his ward Leo Vincey, and their journey to a lost kingdom in the African interior. The journey is triggered by a mysterious package left to Leo by his father, to be opened on his 25th birthday; the package contains an ancient shard of pottery and several documents, suggesting an ancient mystery about the Vincey family. Holly and Leo eventually arrive in eastern Africa where they encounter a primitive race of natives and a mysterious white queen, Ayesha, who reigns as the all-powerful ""She"" or ""She-who-must-be-obeyed"" and who has a mysterious connection to young Leo. The story expresses numerous racial and evolutionary conceptions of the late Victorians, especially notions of degeneration and racial decline prominent during the fin de siècle. In the figure of She, the novel notably explored themes of female authority and feminine behaviour. It has received praise and criticism alike for its representation of womanhood.

From Kapital sprung the economic and political systems that at one time dominated half the earth and for nearly a century kept the world on the brink of war. Even today, more than one billion Chinese citizens live under a regime that proclaims fealty to Marxist ideology. Yet this important tome has been passed over by many readers frustrated by Marx’s difficult style and his preoccupation with nineteenth-century events of little relevance to today's reader.Here Serge Levitsky presents a revised version of Kapital, abridged to emphasize the political and philosophical core of Marx’s work while trimming away much that is now unimportant. Pointing out Marx’s many erroneous predictions about the development of capitalism, Levitsky's introduction nevertheless argues for Kapital's relevance as a prime example of a philosophy of economic determinism that ""subordinates the problems of human freedom and human dignity to the issues of who should own the means of production and how wealth should be distributed.""Here then is a fresh and highly readable version of a work whose ideas provided inspiration for communist regimes' ideological war against capitalism, a struggle that helped to shape the world today.",German,9780895267115,"['Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'History', 'Sociology', 'Theory', 'German Literature', 'Business']",[],Paperback,Abridged,356,Gateway Editions,July 1st 1996,10/28/67,[],8160,"['3026', '2419', '1710', '570', '435']",88.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388289025l/238953.jpg,363,4,5.78

Woods (translator)",4.43,"This remarkable new translation of the Nobel Prize-winner’s great masterpiece is a major literary event.Thomas Mann regarded his monumental retelling of the biblical story of Joseph as his magnum opus. He conceived of the four parts–The Stories of Jacob, Young Joseph, Joseph in Egypt, and Joseph the Provider–as a unified narrative, a “mythological novel” of Joseph’s fall into slavery and his rise to be lord over Egypt. Deploying lavish, persuasive detail, Mann conjures for us the world of patriarchs and pharaohs, the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Palestine, and the universal force of human love in all its beauty, desperation, absurdity, and pain. The result is a brilliant amalgam of humor, emotion, psychological insight, and epic grandeur.Now the award-winning translator John E. Woods gives us a definitive new English version of Joseph and His Brothers that is worthy of Mann’s achievement, revealing the novel’s exuberant polyphony of ancient and modern voices, a rich music that is by turns elegant, coarse, and sublime.--front flap",English,9781400040018,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'German Literature', 'Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Germany', 'Religion', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Egypt']","['Joseph, son of Jacob (Bible)', 'Jacob (Bible)']",Hardcover,Everyman's Library #287 (US / CAN),1492,Everyman's Library (Knopf),May 10th 2005,10/28/43,['Κρατικό Βραβείο Λογοτεχνικής Μετάφρασης for Μετάφραση Έργου Ξένης Λογοτεχνίας στην Ελληνική Γλώσσα (2005)'],1605,"['990', '377', '188', '35', '15']",97.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320550455l/88076.jpg,263,3,24.21

Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. Generations of readers have been enchanted by Dickens’s A Christmas Carol—the most cheerful ghost story ever written, and the unforgettable tale of Ebenezer Scrooge’s moral regeneration. Written in just a few weeks, A Christmas Carol famously recounts the plight of Bob Cratchit, whose family finds joy even in poverty, and the transformation of his miserly boss Scrooge as he is visited by the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future.From Scrooge’s “Bah!” and “Humbug!” to Tiny Tim’s “God bless us every one!” A Christmas Carol shines with warmth, decency, kindness, humility, and the value of the holidays. But beneath its sentimental surface, A Christmas Carol offers another of Dickens’s sharply critical portraits of a brutal society, and an inspiring celebration of the possibility of spiritual, psychological, and social change.This new volume collects Dickens’s three most renowned “Christmas Books,” including The Chimes, a New Year’s tale, and The Cricket on the Hearth, whose eponymous creature remains silent during sorrow and chirps amid happiness.Katharine Kroeber Wiley, the daughter of a scholar and a sculptor, has a degree in English Literature from Occidental College. Her work has appeared in Boundary Two and the recent book, Lore of the Dolphin. She is currently working on a book on Victorian Christmas writings.",English,9781593080334,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Christmas', 'Literature', 'Short Stories', 'Fantasy', 'Classic Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Victorian', 'Holiday']","['Timothy Cratchit', 'Scrooge']",Paperback,Barnes & Noble Classics Series,304,Barnes Noble Classics,March 25th 2004,12/19/43,[],56144,"['24709', '17914', '10401', '2300', '820']",94.0,['United Kingdom'],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1424149988l/169848.jpg,235,3,0.85

This twenty-eight-year-old may have a checkered past littered with romantic mistakes, excessive drinking, and creative vandalism; she may be addicted to Get Smart reruns and prefer entering homes through windows rather than doors -- but the upshot is she's good at her job as a licensed private investigator with her family's firm, Spellman Investigations. Invading people's privacy comes naturally to Izzy. In fact, it comes naturally to all the Spellmans. If only they could leave their work at the office. To be a Spellman is to snoop on a Spellman; tail a Spellman; dig up dirt on, blackmail, and wiretap a Spellman. Part Nancy Drew, part Dirty Harry, Izzy walks an indistinguishable line between Spellman family member and Spellman employee. Duties include: completing assignments from the bosses, aka Mom and Dad (preferably without scrutiny); appeasing her chronically perfect lawyer brother (often under duress); setting an example for her fourteen-year-old sister, Rae (who's become addicted to ""recreational surveillance""); and tracking down her uncle (who randomly disappears on benders dubbed ""Lost Weekends""). But when Izzy's parents hire Rae to follow her (for the purpose of ascertaining the identity of Izzy's new boyfriend), Izzy snaps and decides that the only way she will ever be normal is if she gets out of the family business. But there's a hitch: she must take one last job before they'll let her go -- a fifteen-year-old, ice-cold missing person case.

13020.King_Henry_IV_Part_1,"King Henry IV, Part 1",Wars of the Roses #2,"William Shakespeare, David Scott Kastan (Editor)",3.83,"
  
    David Scott Kastan lucidly explores the remarkable richness and the ambitious design of King Henry IV Part 1 and shows how these complicate any easy sense of what kind of play it is. Conventionally regarded as a history play, much of it is in fact conspicuously invented fiction, and Kastan argues that the non-historical, comic plot does not simply parody the historical action but by its existence raises questions about the very nature of history. The full and engaging introduction devotes extensive discussion to the play's language, indicating how its insistent economic vocabulary provides texture for the social concerns of the play and focuses attention on the central relationship between value and political authority. Kastan also covers the recurrence of the word ""honor"" in the text and the role that women play.  Appendices provide the sources of 1 Henry IV, discussions of Shakespeare's metrics, and the history of the manuscript.  The appendix on casting features a doubling chart to show which characters may be played by one actor.  Photographic images of the original Q0 Fragment, which is assumed to have been printed in Peter Short's printing house in 1598, appear in the fifth appendix. Finally, a reference section provides a list of abbreviations and references, a catalog of Shakespeare’s works and works partly by Shakespeare, and citations for the modern productions mentioned in the text, other collated editions of Shakespeare's work, and other related reading.
     
    The Arden Shakespeare has developed a reputation as the pre-eminent critical edition of Shakespeare for its exceptional scholarship, reflected in the thoroughness of each volume. An introduction comprehensively contextualizes the play, chronicling the history and culture that surrounded and influenced Shakespeare at the time of its writing and performance, and closely surveying critical approaches to the work. Detailed appendices address problems like dating and casting, and analyze the differing Quarto and Folio sources. A full commentary by one or more of the play’s foremost contemporary scholars illuminates the text, glossing unfamiliar terms and drawing from an abundance of research and expertise to explain allusions and significant background information. Highly informative and accessible, Arden offers the fullest experience of Shakespeare available to a reader.

188454.The_Old_Wives_Tale,The Old Wives' Tale,The Five Towns #5,Arnold Bennett,3.83,"H.G. Wells described The Old Wives' Tale as ""by far the finest long novel written in English and in the English fashion"". He was, of course, speaking for his own generation, and a hundred years later the opinion may seem somewhat exaggerated. However, there is no doubt that The Old Wives' Tale is a superb novel of its kind, and it is still as readable and enjoyable as ever. First published in 1908, it tells the story of the Baines sisters--shy, retiring Constance and defiant, romantic Sophia--over the course of nearly half a century. Bennett traces the lives of the sisters from childhood in their father's drapery shop in provincial Bursley, England, during the mid-Victorian era, through their married lives, to the modern industrial age, when they are reunited as old women. The setting moves from the Five Towns of the Staffordshire Potteries to exotic and cosmopolitan Paris. It was fascinating to learn from Bennett's journal how he saw an old lady in a cafe and was inspired to think of how her life might have been lived, how she must have once been young. The plot of the novel came to him fairly promptly, and, as they say, the rest is history.

Le ragazze vestono Onyx, o qualunque sia l'ultima griffe in fatto di body, parlano di Avant, di Marsan e delle mode dell'ultimo minuto. I ragazzi invece girano in moto. Le ragazze si preparano a incontrare il ragazzo della loro vita. I ragazzi si sfidano in prove di resistenza fisica, di velocità, di rischio. Fino all'ultimo respiro. SUllo sfondo di una frenetica vita di clan, di banda (il mitico gruppo dei budokani: Schello, Pollo, Lucone), Step e Babi si incontrano. Babi è un'ottima studentessa, Step è un violento, un picchiatore, uno che passa i pomeriggi davanti al bar con gli amici o in palestra e la sera sulla moto o nella bisca dove si gioca a biliardo. Appartengono a due mondi diversi, ma finiscono per innamorarsi. Non è un rapporto semplice perché nessuno dei due cede facilmente. Eppure si trasformano. Babi è irriconoscibile agli occhi dei genitori. Step rivela aspetti che ben poco collimano con la sua immagine, faticosamente costruita, di superduro. E, in effetti, muscoli, palestra e violenza nascondono un trauma, un nodo irrisolto.Tre metri sopra il cielo è un romanzo di vite quotidiane, una commedia romantica, un ritratto moviemntatissimo di adolescenti allo sbando.Pubblicato da un piccolo editore romano, è circolato per anni in fotocopie, diventando un cult fra i giovani della capitale.""Il sole sta salendo, è una bella mattinata.

Meanwhile, an unknowing Quincey Harker, the grown son of Jonathan and Mina, leaves law school for the London stage, only to stumble upon the troubled production of ""Dracula,"" directed and produced by Bram Stoker himself.  The play plunges Quincey into the world of his parents' terrible secrets, but before he can confront them he experiences evil in a way he had never imagined. One by one, the band of heroes that defeated Dracula a quarter-century ago is being hunted down. Could it be that Dracula somehow survived their attack and is seeking revenge?

An indestructible microuniverse, the Void may contain paradise, as the cultists believe, but it is also a deadly threat. For the miraculous reality that exists inside its boundaries demands energy--energy drawn from everything outside those boundaries: from planets, stars, galaxies... from everything that lives. Meanwhile, the parallel story of Edeard, the Waterwalker -- as told through a series of addictive dreams communicated to the gaiasphere via Inigo, the First Dreamer -- continues to unfold. But now the inspirational tale of this idealistic young man takes a darker and more troubling turn as he finds himself faced with powerful new enemies -- and temptations more powerful still. With time running out, a repentant Inigo must decide whether to release Edeard's final dream: a dream whose message is scarcely less dangerous than the pilgrimage promises to be.

Chet might have flunked out of police school (""I'd been the best leaper in K-9 class, which had led to all the trouble in a way I couldn't remember exactly, although blood was involved""), but he's a detective through and through.In this, their first adventure, Chet and Bernie investigate the disappearance of Madison, a teenage girl who may or may not have been kidnapped, but who has definitely gotten mixed up with some very unsavory characters. A well-behaved, gifted student, she didn't arrive home after school and her divorced mother is frantic. Bernie is quick to take the case-something about a cash flow problem that Chet's not all that clear about-and he's relieved, if vaguely suspicious, when Madison turns up unharmed with a story that doesn't add up. But when she disappears for a second time in a week, Bernie and Chet aren't taking any chances; they launch a full-blown investigation. Without a ransom demand, they're not convinced it's a kidnapping, but they are sure of one thing: something smells funny.Their search for clues takes them into the desert to biker bars and other exotic locals, with Chet's highly trained nose leading the way. Both Chet and Bernie bring their own special skills to the hunt, one that puts each of them in peril. But even as the bad guys try to turn the tables, this duo is nothing if not resourceful, and the result is an uncommonly satisfying adventure.With his doggy ways and his endearingly hardboiled voice, Chet is full of heart and occasionally prone to mischief. He is intensely loyal to Bernie, who, though distracted by issues that Chet has difficulty understanding-like divorce, child custody, and other peculiar human concerns-is enormously likable himself, in his flawed, all-too-human way.",English,9781416585831,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Animals', 'Dogs', 'Humor', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Audiobook', 'Crime', 'Cozy Mystery', 'Adult Fiction']","['Chet', 'Bernie Little', 'Susie Sanchez', 'Charlie Little']",Hardcover,First Atria Books hardcover edition,305,Atria Books,February 10th 2009,10/30/08,[],19026,"['4978', '7951', '4893', '958', '246']",94.0,"['Tucson, Arizona (United States)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1342376684l/5600151.jpg,151,2,5.78

The novel follows the adventures of Macko, a resourceful and wise veteran of war, and his young nephew, Zbyszko, the symbol of a maturing nation, as they struggle, along with the unified peoples of Poland and Lithuania, against the oppressive religious military order, the Teutonic Knights. Among the many memorable characters are Jurand, a merciless, bitter fighter consumed with revenge; his daughter, the innocent Danusia, a girl of twelve who must face the barbarity of the German knighthood; the strong-willed Jagienka, equally adept at shooting a crossbow or administering an estate; Hlawa, a Czech squire of noble birth who is as quick with his wit as he is with his axe; Sanderus, a peddler of religious relics and indulgences whose earthly cravings seem greater than any spiritual needs. A host of other memorable characters fills the canvas set against lush, almost magical forests, dangerous marshes replete with tales of human heads walking on spider legs, winter blizzards that blanket the world in a white wonderland - all at once beautiful and foreboding. Splendid castles are described here, court hunts, single combats that test valor and strength. The customs of knights with their code of honor and feelings of love are adroitly explored. The entirety culminates in one of the most important battles in medieval history, the Battle of Grunwald. The Teutonic Knights was published in America in 1900 in various competing translations of erratic quality. Not until 1943 did a translation worthy of this masterpiece appear, but unfortunately its release was limited to Great Britain. It is this translation that has been revised and edited by Miroslaw Lipinski with an eye for both fluidity in the English language and fidelity to the original Polish.",English,9780781804332,"['Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Polish Literature', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'School', 'Poland', 'Medieval', 'War', 'Novels']","['Danusia Jurandówna', 'Zbyszko z Bogdańca', 'Jurand ze Spychowa', 'Maćko z Bogdańca', 'Jagienka ze Zgorzelic']",Hardcover,Illustrated Edition,786,Hippocrene Books,October 1st 1995,10/30/99,[],4496,"['943', '1306', '1185', '648', '414']",76.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387715014l/759212.jpg,133,2,20.00

At sixteen, athletic, honor student Danielle has her life planned out: study hard, play soccer even harder, and slide through high school under the radar. It was a good plan, a solid plan, one that’s worked so far; until Cayden Bridwell—the longtime shy and brainy classmate she has ignored—rides in on his motorcycle and obliterates her plans. Now, life as Danielle knows it, will never be the same. Wealthy Cayden—only recently coming into his own and learning the shocking truth, that as the Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, he is the chosen one, gifted with powers—has shyly stood back and watched unassuming and unsuspecting Danielle, grow into the beautiful girl she is, knowing all along of their destiny to be together, and waiting for the time to be right. After his rapid growth spurt and realizing his full powers and strength, that time is now! Cayden is intent on winning her heart. But the euphoria of their intoxicating attraction is soon shadowed by despair; neither are prepared for the danger that will ensue, the lives that will be at risk, or the secrets they will be forced to keep, when they discover that destiny’s gifts come with a curse, opening their world to nightmares that become reality and mythical legends that become real, with immortal beings seeking to sway Cayden to the dark side to steal his eternal soul and powers—including Danielle, as his destined soul mate… Destiny is a sweet and intoxicating fairy tale romance with a paranormal twist, and the first book in the Destiny series.

When I accidentally started my first mini habit—and the changes I made were actually lasting—I realized the prior strategies I relied on were complete failures. When something works, that which doesn't work is exposed. The science in Mini Habits exposes the predictably inconsistent results of most popular personal growth strategies, and reveals why mini habits are consistent.  A mini habit is a very small positive behavior that you force yourself to do every day; a mini habit's ""too small to fail"" nature makes it weightless, deceptively powerful, and a superior habit-building strategy.  Mini Habits will better equip you to change your life than 99% of the people you see walking around on this globe. People so often think that they are the reason they can't achieve lasting change; but the problem isn't with them—it's with their strategy. You can achieve great things without the guilt, intimidation, and repeated failure associated with such strategies such as ""getting motivated,"" resolutions, or even ""just doing it.” To make changes last, you need to stop fighting against your brain.

Ever since she can remember, Sonia has had to abide by her parents' ridiculously unfair rules like not being allowed to date or even kiss a guy. The only reason she thinks she's being held to these rules is when Sonia was eight, she took a sip of her friend’s drink, causing her friend to do everything Sonia asked. As her eighteenth birthday approaches, Sonia is finally about to learn why; she's a Huldra, a dangerous, yet seductive and magical Norse forest maiden who with just one kiss, has the ability to control humans and appropriate parts of their souls. Keeping the rules hasn't been a problem for Sonia because she's never really been attracted to any guy. But when Anthony transfers to her school, every last rule flies out the window. There's just something about Anthony that she can't resist—the way he seems to be hiding a deep, dark secret that is connected to her, the way his mysterious blue eyes cause her heart to beat more rapidly, his athletic, god-like physique. The closer she gets to her eighteenth birthday—the moment she matures into a fully realized Huldra—the harder it becomes to follow her parents' rules. As graduation day approaches, Anthony starts to show interest in her, but she would never have guessed how life-changing and how dangerous Anthony's secrets are, and how overwhelmingly intense a relationship with him could be.

Fabbri da generazioni, gli Shangguan vivono in un villaggio rurale della zona di Gaomi, nella provincia orientale dello Shandong; a seguito dell'uccisione degli uomini della famiglia da parte degli invasori giapponesi, la giovane madre si ritrova a dover crescere, da sola, il nuovo nato e le sorelline. È Jintong, il Bambino d'oro, l'io narrante del romanzo; frutto in realtà di un amore adulterino con il prete occidentale Ma Luoya, è il figlio prediletto e viziatissimo, allattato fin quasi all'adolescenza, che fa del seno l'icona feticistica di tutta la sua vita. Icona che cercherà crescendo nelle altre donne, a partire dalle sorelle, di cui segue da vicino i destini quanto mai diversi. Ciascuna di loro si legherà infatti a uomini spesso all'opposto per aspirazioni e carattere: proprietari terrieri e banditi patrioti, esponenti del Partito nazionalista e militanti del neonato Partito comunista, occidentali venuti a sostenere una delle fazioni in lotta e bizzarre e macchiettistiche figure. La parabola di ciascun personaggio si salda alla storia travagliata della Cina, dai tardi anni Trenta del conflitto sino-giapponese alle carneficine della guerra civile, fino all'avvento dell'era maoista e al suo superamento nell'ultimo ventennio del secolo appena trascorso.

The greatest warrior of his day, and witness to the greatest defeat of his nation: King Janus’s vision of a Greater Unified Realm drowned in the blood of brave men fighting for a cause Vaelin alone knows was forged from a lie. Sick at heart, he comes home, determined to kill no more. Named Tower Lord of the Northern Reaches by King Janus’s grateful heir, he can perhaps find peace in a colder, more remote land far from the intrigues of a troubled Realm. But those gifted with the blood-song are never destined to live a quiet life. Many died in King Janus’s wars, but many survived, and Vaelin is a target, not just for those seeking revenge but for those who know what he can do. The Faith has been sundered, and many have no doubt who their leader should be. The new King is weak, but his sister is strong. The blood-song is powerful, rich in warning and guidance in times of trouble, but is only a fraction of the power available to others who understand more of its mysteries.

When his former partner and friend, Detective Emily Baxter, calls him to a crime scene, he's sure this is it: the body is made of the dismembered parts of six victims, sewn together like a puppet--a corpse that becomes known as ""The Ragdoll.""Fawkes is tasked with identifying the six victims, but that gets dicey when his reporter ex-wife anonymously receives photographs from the crime scene, along with a list of six names, and the dates on which the Ragdoll Killer plans to murder them.The final name on the list is Fawkes.Baxter and her trainee partner, Alex Edmunds, hone in on figuring out what links the victims together before the killer strikes again. But for Fawkes, seeing his name on the list sparks a dark memory, and he fears that the catalyst for these killings has more to do with him--and his past--than anyone realizes.With a breakneck pace, a twisty plot, and a wicked sense of humor, Ragdoll announces the arrival of the hottest new brand in crime fiction.",English,9781409168744,"['Thriller', 'Crime', 'Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Audiobook', 'Detective', 'Adult', 'Contemporary']",[],Hardcover,UK,384,Trapeze,February 23rd 2017,11/06/17,"['CWA New Blood Dagger Nominee (2017)', 'ITW Thriller Award Nominee for Best First Novel (2018)']",14099,"['4014', '5686', '3341', '811', '247']",92.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1473338167l/30259893._SY475_.jpg,93,1,3.41

Η δράση τοποθετείται αντίστοιχα στην Ιερουσαλήμ, στο Κάιρο, στην Αλεξάνδρεια. Ένα μυθιστόρημα που τιθασεύει αριστοτεχνικά μια χειμαρρώδη ιστορική ύλη, δίνοντας ανθρώπινη φωνή στο έπος και στο δράμα του Β΄ Παγκοσμίου Πολέμου, την ώρα που κρινόταν το μέλλον των λαών και παίχτηκε στα ζάρια η τύχη της Ελλάδας. Χάρη σε ποικίλες αναδρομές, η τριλογία ζωντανεύει και προγενέστερες περιόδους, από τον Μεσοπόλεμο, τον χλωρό παράδεισο της εφηβείας με τα πρώτα ερωτικά σκιρτήματα κάποιων ηρώων, ως την παλιά Αίγυπτο, ανακαλώντας μνήμες προγόνων. Το έργο κορυφώνεται με την εξέγερση του Στρατού και του Στόλου, το κίνημα του Απρίλη 1944 και τη δραματική καταστολή του, ενώ, με τον επίλογο του γ΄ τόμου, μεταφερόμαστε στη Θεσσαλονίκη μετά τον Εμφύλιο, το 1954, όπου ακούγεται ένα συγκλονιστικό ρέκβιεμ για τους χαμένους αγωνιστές.Ωστόσο, ο Τσίρκας δεν έγραψε χρονικό, αλλά έργο τέχνης. Ιστορική ακρίβεια και φαντασία σπάνια δένονται σ' ένα τόσο αρμονικό σύνολο. Κινώντας στιβαρά μεγάλους όγκους, καταγράφει ευαίσθητα τις απηχήσεις των γεγονότων στη συνείδηση και στις σχέσεις των ανθρώπων, πλάθοντας ολοζώντανες μορφές που θα μείνουν στο πάνθεον των μυθιστορηματικών ηρώων. Πολιτικές μηχανορραφίες, αχαλίνωτες φιλοδοξίες μέσα στη δίνη του πολέμου, αλλά και ωραία όνειρα και περίσσευμα ανθρωπιάς και γενναιότητας δίνουν το στίγμα των ""Ακυβέρνητων Πολιτειών"", όπου ο έρωτας, κυρίαρχος, τυλίγει και ξετυλίγει το νήμα μιας συναρπαστικής πλοκής. Παράλληλα, με την πολυφωνία της αφήγησης και άλλες νεωτερικές τεχνοτροπίες, ο συγγραφέας κατορθώνει να συγχωνεύσει τον μοντερνισμό με την παράδοση. Ένα μεταιχμιακό έργο, που σφράγισε τα ελληνικά γράμματα σ' αυτό τον ""σύντομο 20ό αιώνα"".","Greek, Modern (1453-)",9789600427028,"['Fiction', 'Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics']",[],Paperback,"|| 32η έκδοση (ανατύπωση): 2002.

King (Goodreads Author),3.89,"When a band of homeless people cremate a beloved dog in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, the authorities are willing to overlook a few broken regulations. But three weeks later, when the dog's owner gets the same fiery send-off, the SFPD has a real headache on its hands. The autopsy suggests homicide, but Inspector Kate Martinelli and her partner, Al Hawkin, have little else to go on. They have a homeless victim without a positive ID, a group of witnesses who have little love for the cops, and a possible suspect, known only as Brother Erasmus, who is certainly articulate, but difficult to understand.Erasmus, Kate learns, is well-acquainted with the park's homeless and with the rarefied atmosphere of Berkeley's Graduate Theological Union, yet he is an enigma to all. He has a genius for blending with his surroundings, yet he stands out wherever he goes. He is by no means crazy—but he is a fool.  Kate begins the frustrating task of interrogating a man who communicates only through quotations. Trying to learn something of his history leads her along a twisting road to a disbanded cult, long-buried secrets, the thirst for spirituality, and the hunger for bloody vengeance.",English,9780553574555,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Mystery Thriller', 'LGBT', 'Lesbian', 'Detective', 'Queer', 'Audiobook', 'Suspense']","['Kate Martinelli', 'Al Hawkin', 'Brother Erasmus']",Mass Market Paperback,Crime Line ,286,Bantam Books,June 1st 1996,02/01/95,[],3869,"['1035', '1608', '1033', '160', '33']",95.0,"['San Francisco, California (United States)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386920907l/170226.jpg,87,1,3.04

20653500-the-complete-emily-starr-trilogy,The Complete Emily Starr Trilogy: Emily of New Moon / Emily Climbs . Emily's Quest,Emily #1-3,L.M. Montgomery,4.41,"This carefully crafted ebook: “The Complete Emily Starr Trilogy: Emily of New Moon + Emily Climbs + Emily's Quest (Unabridged)” is formatted for your eReader with a functional and detailed table of contents. The author, Lucy Maud Montgomery, created another and better-known representative of Canadian girlhood in ""Anne of Green Gables"" and all the subsequent Anne books, but Emily was closer to her own heart. Like Anne, Emily is a strong-minded, gifted, imaginative child, left alone and unprotected in a harsh world, who is taken in by adults who are at least initially cold and unloving. Both girls grow up amid the beauties of Prince Edward Island, both keenly sensitive to natural splendors and highly fanciful, not to say occasionally precious, about assigning names to lakes and trees and identifying spirits and fairies in their surroundings. Anne is an original and spunky girl, with a certain amount of talent for writing verses and romantic tales, but Emily is a writer.In the celebrated Emily trilogy, of which Emily of New Moon is the first volume, Montgomery draws a more realistic portrait of a young girl’s life on Prince Edward Island. The twin threads of bright and dark, love and cruelty, hope and despair intertwine in a pattern as significant as it is enduring.In the second volume, Emily Climbs, Lucy Maud Montgomery traces the often stormy course of Emily Starr’s life as she moves from the world of childhood into that of school and adolescence.Emily's Quest is the last of the Emily trilogy. After finishing Emily Climbs, Montgomery suspended writing Emily's Quest and published The Blue Castle; she resumed writing and published in 1927.Lucy Maud Montgomery (1874 – 1942), was a Canadian author best known for a series of novels beginning with Anne of Green Gables. Montgomery went on to publish 20 novels as well as 530 short stories, 500 poems, and 30 essays.",English,9780553333084,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Historical Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Canada', 'Novels', 'Literature']",[],Kindle Edition,Unabridged,794,e-artnow,December 30th 2013,11/06/27,[],1759,"['1013', '513', '183', '37', '13']",97.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1436809206l/20653500._SY475_.jpg,86,1,12.85

Though she’s been dealing with a quarter-life crisis and post-college syndrome like any other twenty-something, she’s still not what you would call “ordinary.” For one thing, there’s her past which she likes to pretend never happened, and then there’s the fact that she sees ghosts. Luckily for her, that all comes in handy when she stumbles across Dex Foray, an eccentric producer for an upcoming webcast on ghost hunters. Even though the show’s budget is non-existent and Dex himself is a maddening enigma, Perry is instantly drawn into a world that both threatens her life and seduces her with a sense of importance. Her uncle’s haunted lighthouse provides the perfect catalyst and backdrop for a horrific mystery that unravels the threads of Perry’s fragile sanity and causes her to fall for a man, who, like the most dangerous of ghosts, may not be all that he seems.",English,9781461079859,"['Paranormal', 'Horror', 'Ghosts', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Mystery', 'New Adult', 'Paranormal Romance', 'Supernatural']","['Dex Foray', 'Perry Palomino']",Paperback,2nd Edition,306,Metal Blonde Books,March 10th 2012,05/01/11,[],15890,"['5088', '5278', '3532', '1129', '863']",87.0,['Oregon (United States)'],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1602888946l/11356211._SY475_.jpg,83,2,16.46

Rebecca ha trentatré anni, più di cento paia di scarpe, un armadio pieno di tubini neri, completi di tweed e una smisurata passione per la magnifica Coco. È romantica, sognatrice, e follemente innamorata di Niccolò, che sta per raggiungere a Milano, dopo un anno di relazione a distanza. Un nuovo lavoro come wedding planner, una vita vicino all'uomo che ama: la felicità sembra a portata di mano. Ma una brutta sorpresa è in agguato: appena giunta nella metropoli, Niccolò le confessa di essersi innamorato di un'altra. Rebecca si ritrova così in una città che non conosce e con il cuore a pezzi. Ma il suo mito, la grande Coco, come avrebbe reagito? Indossando degli enormi occhiali scuri, alzando la testa in segno di sfida, non avrebbe mai permesso a un uomo di schiacciare il suo spirito ribelle e anticonvenzionale! ""Per essere insostituibili bisogna essere unici"", e forse Niccolò, unico non lo era.

77678.The_Lays_of_Beleriand,The Lays of Beleriand,The History of Middle-Earth #3,"J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien (Editor)",3.97,"This is the third volume of the History of Middle-earth, which comprises here-tofore unpublished manuscripts that were written over a period of many years before Tolkien's Simlarillion was published. Volumes 1 and 2 were the Book of Lost Tales, Part One and The Book of Lost Tales, Part Two. Together, these volumes encompass an extraordinarily extensive body of material ornamenting and buttressing what must be the most fully realized world ever to spring from a single author's imagination.""I write alliterative verse with pleasure,"" wrote J.R.R. Tolkien in 1955, ""though I have published little beyond the fragments in The Lord of the Rings, except The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth."" The first of the poems in The Lays of Beleriand is the previously unpublished Lay of the Children of Hurin, his early but most sustained work in the ancient English meter, intended to narrate on a grand scale the tragedy of Turin Turambar. It was account of the killing by Turin of his friend Beleg, as well as a unique description of the great redoubt of Nargothrond. The Lay of the Children of Hurin was supplanted by the Lay of Leithian, ""Release from Bondage"", in which another major legend of the Elder Days received poetic form, in this case in rhyme. The chief source of the short prose tale of Beren and Luthien is The Silmarillion. This, too, was not completed, but the whole Quest of the Silmaril is told, and the poem breaks off only after the encounter with Morgoth in his subterranean fortress. Many years later, when The Lord of the rings was finished, J.R.R. Tolkien returned to the Lay of Leithian and started on a new version, which is also given in this book.Accompanying the poems are commentaries on the evolution of the history of the Elder Days, which was much developed during the years of the composition of the two Lays. Also included is the notable criticism in detail of the Lay of Lethian by C.S. Lewis, Tolkien's friend and colleague, who read the poem in 1929. By assuming that this poem is actually a fragment from a past lost in history, Lewis underlined the remarkable power of its author's imaginative talents and academic competence.",English,9780395394298,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Classics', 'High Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Reference', 'Literature', 'Mythology']",[],Hardcover,First US Edition,393,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,November 20th 1985,08/22/85,[],3312,"['1148', '1132', '853', '148', '31']",95.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1374681487l/77678.jpg,82,1,37.59

Crafted by two masters of inspirational fiction--Janette Oke and T.

Such diverse populations did not live in accord, however. Instead, they were isolated within their own groups by a brewing political tension under the difficult English rule.Amid such chaotic times two women, both about to become brides and both trying to live lives of quiet peace, meet in a lush field of wildflowers. Louisa, a Frenchwoman, and Catherine, who is English, continue to meet secretly through the seasons, sharing both friendship and growing faith.The outside world does not mirror their own tranquil happiness, and the dreaded crackdown by the English throne threatens far more than their growing bond. In the face of a heart-wrenching dilemma, Louisa and Catherine strive to maintain their faith and cling to their dreams of family and home.

For those who only know Clive Barker through his long multigenre novels, this complete edition of the Books of Blood is a welcome chance to acquire all six volumes and 30 remarkable horror short stories written by the British author Clive Barker. For those who already know these tales, the poignant introduction is a window on the creator's mind. Reflecting back after 14 years, Barker writes:  I look at these pieces and I don't think the man who wrote them is alive in me anymore.... We are all our own graveyards I believe; we squat amongst the tombs of the people we were. If we're healthy, every day is a celebration, a Day of the Dead, in which we give thanks for the lives that we lived; and if we are neurotic we brood and mourn and wish that the past was still present. Reading these stories over, I feel a little of both. Some of the simple energies that made these words flow through my pen--that made the phrases felicitous and the ideas sing--have gone. I lost their maker a long time ago.  These enthusiastic tales are not ashamed of visceral horror, of blood splashing freely across the page: ""The Midnight Meat Train,"" a grisly subway tale that surprises you with one twist after another; ""The Yattering and Jack,"" about a hilarious demon who possesses a Christmas turkey; ""In the Hills, the Cities,"" an unusual example of an original horror premise; ""Dread,"" a harrowing non-supernatural tale about being forced to realize your worst nightmare; ""Jacqueline Ess: Her Will and Testament,"" about a woman who kills men with her mind. Some of the tales are more successful than others, but all are distinguished by strikingly beautiful images of evil and destruction.

One, a girl, refuses to bring animals to their death in the hunt. The other, a boy, wears a blindfold lest his eyes and his anger kill. In this beautifully crafted story, Ursula K.

Scott Bakker,3.98,"The Darkness That Comes Before, The Warrior Prophet, and The Thousandfold Thought — collectively the Prince of Nothing Saga — were R. Scott Bakker's magnificent debut into the upper echelon of epic fantasy. In those three books, Bakker created a world that was at once a triumph of the fantastic and an historical epic as real as any that came before.Widely praised by reviewers and a growing body of fans, Bakker has already established the reputation as one of the smartest writers in the fantasy genre-a writer in the line stretching from Homer to Peake to Tolkein. Now he returns to The Prince of Nothing with the long awaited The Judging Eye, the first book in an all-new series. Set twenty years after the end of The Thousandfold Thought, Bakker reintroduces us to a world that is at once familiar but also very different than the one readers thought they knew. Delving even further into his richly imagined universe of myth, violence, and sorcery, and fully remolding the fantasy genre to broaden the scope of intricacy and meaning, R. Scott Bakker has once again written a fantasy novel that defies all expectations and rewards the reader with an experience unlike any to be had in the canon of today's literature.",English,9781590201695,"['Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Dark Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Philosophy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Canada', 'Speculative Fiction']","['Drusas Achamian', 'Anasurimbor Kellhus', 'Esmenet', 'Mimara']",Hardcover,First,437,The Overlook Press,February 19th 2009,01/15/09,[],5593,"['1841', '2261', '1143', '247', '101']",94.0,[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1439382841l/4117865._SY475_.jpg,58,1,6.70

40923.Theodore_Rex,Theodore Rex,Theodore Roosevelt #2,Edmund Morris,4.18,"Theodore Roosevelt and his two-term presidency (1901-9) deserve a king-size, seize-the-man biography - and Edmund Morris has provided one. ""TR"" typifies the ""can do"" American; his famous maxim, of course, was ""Speak softly but carry a big stick."" Morris presents eyewitness history through the voices of the makers and shakers. His exhilarating narrative will captivate readers, providing welcome confirmation that this nation can produce presidents who bring leadership to great issues, hold to their purpose, and shape the destinies of nations. President McKinley's assassination brought the 43-year-old TR a challenging presidency, one to which Morris is a clearsighted guide. At home, TR had to persuade Congress to curb competition-stifling corporate trusts, monopolistic transcontinental railroads, and unhygienic food industries that saw consumers as sheep. He also faced labor and racial strife. Abroad, the American presence in Cuba and the Philippines brought criticism, the Russo-Japanese conflict threatened major power shifts in the Far East and Europe, and a politically and financially fraught decision on the Central American canal route - Panama or Nicaragua? - had to be made. TR rose to every challenge. Despite the demands of family and social life, he read, wrote, and traveled extensively. Not least, TR put national parks and conservation of natural resources on the legislative agenda.All TR's notable contemporaries - including historian Henry Adams, naturalists John Burroughs and John Muir, robber barons E. H. Harriman and James J. Hill, poet Oliver Wendell Holmes, financier J. P. Morgan, fellow politician William Howard Taft, civil rights leader Booker T. Washington, and novelist Owen Wister - appear onstage, their clear voices projecting the excitement of the day.Morris is blessed with the imagination and skills to write gripping popular history. He doesn't dilute but illuminates events in presenting an account that immediately sparks interest and captures the mind. Readers will note that American interventionism abroad (today's major issue) was much debated during TR's presidency, when major interventional imperatives challenged the new superpower's tradition of relative restraint in foreign affairs.Theodore Rex is the long-awaited second volume of the TR saga. Morris delivered the first volume,

Steven Weinberg introduces the fundamentals of classical physics that played crucial roles in these discoveries. Connections are shown throughout the book between the historic discoveries of subatomic particles and contemporary research at the frontiers of physics, including the most current discoveries of new elementary particles.

At Texas he holds the Josey Regental Chair of Science and is a member of the Physics and Astronomy Departments. His research has spanned a broad range of topics in quantum field theory, elementary particle physics, and cosmology, and has been honored with numerous awards, including the Nobel Prize in Physics, the National Medal of Science, the Heinemann Prize in Mathematical Physics, the Cresson Medal of the Franklin Institute, the Madison Medal of Princeton University, and the Oppenheimer Prize.

Η δράση τοποθετείται αντίστοιχα στην Ιερουσαλήμ, στο Κάιρο, στην Αλεξάνδρεια. Ένα μυθιστόρημα που τιθασεύει αριστοτεχνικά μια χειμαρρώδη ιστορική ύλη, δίνοντας ανθρώπινη φωνή στο έπος και στο δράμα του Β΄ Παγκοσμίου Πολέμου, την ώρα που κρινόταν το μέλλον των λαών και παίχτηκε στα ζάρια η τύχη της Ελλάδας. Χάρη σε ποικίλες αναδρομές, η τριλογία ζωντανεύει και προγενέστερες περιόδους, από τον Μεσοπόλεμο, τον χλωρό παράδεισο της εφηβείας με τα πρώτα ερωτικά σκιρτήματα κάποιων ηρώων, ως την παλιά Αίγυπτο, ανακαλώντας μνήμες προγόνων. Το έργο κορυφώνεται με την εξέγερση του Στρατού και του Στόλου, το κίνημα του Απρίλη 1944 και τη δραματική καταστολή του, ενώ, με τον επίλογο του γ΄ τόμου, μεταφερόμαστε στη Θεσσαλονίκη μετά τον Εμφύλιο, το 1954, όπου ακούγεται ένα συγκλονιστικό ρέκβιεμ για τους χαμένους αγωνιστές.Ωστόσο, ο Τσίρκας δεν έγραψε χρονικό, αλλά έργο τέχνης. Ιστορική ακρίβεια και φαντασία σπάνια δένονται σ' ένα τόσο αρμονικό σύνολο. Κινώντας στιβαρά μεγάλους όγκους, καταγράφει ευαίσθητα τις απηχήσεις των γεγονότων στη συνείδηση και στις σχέσεις των ανθρώπων, πλάθοντας ολοζώντανες μορφές που θα μείνουν στο πάνθεον των μυθιστορηματικών ηρώων. Πολιτικές μηχανορραφίες, αχαλίνωτες φιλοδοξίες μέσα στη δίνη του πολέμου, αλλά και ωραία όνειρα και περίσσευμα ανθρωπιάς και γενναιότητας δίνουν το στίγμα των ""Ακυβέρνητων Πολιτειών"", όπου ο έρωτας, κυρίαρχος, τυλίγει και ξετυλίγει το νήμα μιας συναρπαστικής πλοκής. Παράλληλα, με την πολυφωνία της αφήγησης και άλλες νεωτερικές τεχνοτροπίες, ο συγγραφέας κατορθώνει να συγχωνεύσει τον μοντερνισμό με την παράδοση.

È ebrea, benestante e ha dei genitori che da sempre le riservano poche attenzioni. Ryan, di origini irlandesi, è il maggiore di quattro figli maschi e la sua caotica famiglia gestisce un tipico pub nel cuore della Grande Mela. I due si sono conosciuti alla scuola di legge di Yale, dove hanno ferocemente lottato per il posto di direttore del giornale. Amalia è rimasta a New York, Ryan ha invece fatto carriera a Chicago, finché l’offerta per il posto da vice procuratore non lo riporta a New York. Il primo caso che si trova ad affrontare sembra davvero banale: arresto per guida in stato di ebbrezza di una giovane rampolla. E se quel che appare semplice si complicasse inaspettatamente?
